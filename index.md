# Hi there!

Thank you for stopping by, and welcome to my home!

I am a postdoctoral Research Associate at the School of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of Sheffield, UK. I am a member of the [Algebraic Geometry and Mathematical Physics group](http://alg-geom.group.shef.ac.uk/){: target="\_blank"}, where my mentor is **Andrea Brini**. I am a mathematical physicist, and my research lies at the boundary of String Theory and Algebraic Geometry. I'm particularly interested in studying enumerative properties (ultimately related to sheaf counting problems) of moduli spaces - actually, stacks - arising from quiver matrix models in Supersymmetric String Theories, along with their connection to physics and combinatorics. These include, but are not limited to, local models for Donaldson-Thomas, Pandharipande-Thomas and Vafa-Witten theory, some of their refinements, generalisations and orbifold counterparts. The toolset I use is a mix of rigorous mathematical techniques and less rigorous physical ones, ranging from supersymmetric to K-theoretic and motivic localisation. Lately, I've also got interested in some applications of Gromov-Witten theory to the determination of the spectrum of Fredholm determinants of mirror curves.

In 2021/2022, together with Nikita Nikolaev, I'm organising the [Sheffield Geometry and Physics Seminar](http://alg-geom.group.shef.ac.uk/seminars/SGaPS/){: target="\_blank"}, taking place roughly once every two weeks from February to early June.

Before landing in Sheffield, I was a PhD student at SISSA, Trieste. There I got my PhD in Mathematics under the supervision of **Giulio Bonelli** and **Alessandro Tanzini**. You can have a look at a PDF version of [my PhD thesis](https://iris.sissa.it/retrieve/handle/20.500.11767/116289/129656/PhD%20Thesis%20-%20Nadir%20Fasola.pdf){: target="\_blank"} if you like. Previously, I got both my BSc and my MSc in Physics at the University of Insubria, Como, under the supervision of **Ugo Moschella**. Before turning to String Theory and Algebraic Geometry, I was working on axiomatic QFTs on curved spacetimes. My [master thesis]({{ './assets/documents/Nadir Fasola - MSc thesis.pdf' | relative_url }}){: target="\_blank"} - Italian only, I'm afraid - dealt with a (somewhat) geometric approach to the rigorous quantisation of a scalar massive field in the Anti-de Sitter universe (in any dimension). Here is [my CV](#).

Outside academia, I love doing many - arguably too many - things. Here is a [collection of things I find exciting](./alter-ego/).
